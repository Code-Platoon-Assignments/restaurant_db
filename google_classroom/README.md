# App Scripts for Google Classroom

## Requirements

You will need to follow & do [this Google Guide on setting up local App Scripts Development using Typescript](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/guides/typescript).

Be sure to [install and configure clasp](https://github.com/google/clasp) so you can interact with Google App Scripts from the command line.

## Recommended before first use

In a separate directory follow this [Google tutorial on writing a "hello world" app script in Typescript.](https://github.com/google/clasp/blob/master/docs/typescript.md) This will familiarize you with clasp and with Google App Scripts. Also read that doc in full **as there are several gotchas.**

## Installation

1. `npm install`
2. Run `clasp pull` and then `clasp open` to confirm clasp is set up. This will pull down the app script project from Google cloud, and then, open the project code in google's in-browser editor. This is just to confirm you have correct accesses.
